        The limit with regards to the size of the data-set depends on several factors:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How large a part must be in the user's RAM at any given time.<br>
                if the user has a sloppy computer with almost no available RAM, then a data-set of more than 100 MB could be too much.<br>
                Note that the size of our data-set was a mere 11.1KB.
            </li>
            <li>
                How many calculations are performed on the data.<br>
                If the computations performed are very intensive, then even a small data-set (Like ours) might be too much.<br>
                This factor is often open for optimization, through well written code.
            </li>
            <li>
                The visuals.<br>
                So this is really a subcategory of the previous bullet; With computationally heavy (Or just semi-heavy)
                visuals that scale with the size of the data-set (Maybe a 1:1 ratio of data-rows and HTML-elements?),
                the users CPU and RAM can quickly become overloaded.<br>
                Again, this should be flexible since there are few visuals that are simply <i>required</i> and can't be visualized differently.
            </li>
        </ul>

        So this means that the type of visualisations that are most likely to be too intense, are those that require dynamic modelling of very many HTML-elements.<br>
        Say for instance, that you somehow could model every person on the earth's current position;
        First of all, all the HTML elements required to display that would consume an immense amount of RAM.
        Secondly, if you were to continuously update all these elements, your processor would likely get some sort of cancer.<br>
        <br>
        The only way I could imagine dealing with this sort of visualisation, would be to only pick tiny bits at a time.
        And if an overview was required, then I would sub-sample the visuals; I.e. maybe one HTML-element for every million or ten million people.<br>
        <br>
        With regards to the data-set used in this assignment, we could have used only the yearly averages, but then one part of the visualisation would be gone.<br>
        We could also have sub-sampled the data-set, like pre-computing the averages of every five years.
        However, this would means that a lot of the variability would disappear.
