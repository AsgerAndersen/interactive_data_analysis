        <h3>Description of our visualizations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>Data used in the visualizations:</b> In both of our visualizations, we have used <a href = "https://data.giss.nasa.gov/tmp/gistemp/STATIONS/tmp_612061860000_14_0/station.txt">this</a> dataset. The dataset consists of temperature measurements from the Copenhagen weather station. For each month since January 1880 and until October 2017, it has the mean of the monthly temperature measurements. The data set also contains the annual and seasonal means. We got the dataset from the website of <a href = "https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/">Goddard Instistute for Space Studies </a>, which is a part of NASA. A further description of the dataset can be found <a href = "https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/seas_ann_means.html">here</a>. </li>
                <li> <b>Visualization 1: </b> Our first visualization is a scatter plot of the annual temperature means trough time. This means that we have used distance to the right to visually represent time and distance up to visually represent tempature. We have also added a regression line found by using linear regresssion with year as dependent and annual temperatur mean as independent variable.</li>
                <li> <b>Visualization 2: </b> Our second visualization ranks all years by their annual temperature mean and display a list of the year number  </li>
                <li> <b>Interactive subsetting of the data:</b> </li>
            </ul>

        The limit with regards to the size of the data-set depends on several factors:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How large a part must be in the user's RAM at any given time.<br>
                if the user has a sloppy computer with almost no available RAM, then a data-set of more than 100 MB could be too much.<br>
                Note that the size of our data-set was a mere 11.1KB.
            </li>
            <li>
                How many calculations are performed on the data.<br>
                If the computations performed are very intensive, then even a small data-set (Like ours) might be too much.<br>
                This factor is often open for optimization, through well written code.
            </li>
            <li>
                The visuals.<br>
                So this is really a subcategory of the previous bullet; With computationally heavy (Or just semi-heavy)
                visuals that scale with the size of the data-set (Maybe a 1:1 ratio of data-rows and HTML-elements?),
                the users CPU and RAM can quickly become overloaded.<br>
                Again, this should be flexible since there are few visuals that are simply <i>required</i> and can't be visualized differently.
            </li>
        </ul>

        So this means that the type of visualisations that are most likely to be too intense, are those that require dynamic modelling of very many HTML-elements.<br>
        Say for instance, that you somehow could model every person on the earth's current position;
        First of all, all the HTML elements required to display that would consume an immense amount of RAM.
        Secondly, if you were to continuously update all these elements, your processor would likely get some sort of cancer.<br>
        <br>
        The only way I could imagine dealing with this sort of visualisation, would be to only pick tiny bits at a time.
        And if an overview was required, then I would sub-sample the visuals; I.e. maybe one HTML-element for every million or ten million people.<br>
        <br>
        With regards to the data-set used in this assignment, we could have used only the yearly averages, but then one part of the visualisation would be gone.<br>
        We could also have sub-sampled the data-set, like pre-computing the averages of every five years.
        However, this would means that a lot of the variability would disappear.
