        <h3>Description of our visualizations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>Data used in the visualizations:</b> In both of our visualizations, we have used <a href = "https://data.giss.nasa.gov/tmp/gistemp/STATIONS/tmp_612061860000_14_0/station.txt">this</a> dataset. The dataset consists of temperature measurements from the Copenhagen weather station. For each month since January 1880 and until October 2017, it has the mean of the monthly temperature measurements. The data set also contains the annual and seasonal means. We got the dataset from the website of <a href = "https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/">Goddard Instistute for Space Studies </a>, which is a part of NASA. A further description of the dataset can be found <a href = "https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/seas_ann_means.html">here</a>. </li>
                <li> <b>Interactive subsetting of the data:</b> We have allowed the user to determine, which subsets of the temperature dataset that our visualizations use. By default, they use the annual means, but the user can also choose to view only the seasonal means from a specific season or the monthly means from a specific month. If the user for instance tick the checkbox named Spring, then for each year only the temperature mean over the months March, April and May will be used. The user can also choose to view only a subset of the years from 1880 to 2017.</li>
                <li> <b>Visualization 1: </b> Our first visualization is a scatter plot of the temperature means trough time. In the completely standard way, we have used distance to the right to visually represent one of the continuous variables (time) and distance up to visually represent the other continuous variable (tempature). We have also given the user the possibility to add a regression line found by using linear regresssion with year as dependent and annual temperatur mean as independent variable.</li>
                <li> <b>Visualization 2: </b> Our second visualization ranks all years by their temperature means and display this ranking as a stream of blocks that should be read along the reading direction. The years are colored by decade, so the viewer for instance easily can see which decades the top ten hottest years are from. If the user wish to color the years in larger than 10 contiguous years, the group size can be controlled with a slider. The user can also control the number of columns in the visualization (first, we imagined the visualization with only one column to be read from top to bottom, but this does not fit very well in the browser window).</li>

<h3>How our visualizations can be used to explore the main question of the project</h3>
From visualization 1, it can be seen that although there are quite a bit of variation in temperature means between contiguous years, then the means still tends to be rising as a function of time. If we subset the data by the seasons one after one and add the regression line, we see that the rising tendency is strongest in the spring and fall, and weakest in the summer. If we subset the data by the months one after one and add the regression line, we see that the rising tendency is strongest in March, and weakest in the June. From visualization 2, we also see that the hottest years between 1880 and 2017 tend to positioned in the recent decades. For instance, we see that all the 5 hottest years are from the last two decades, and 14 out of 15 of the hottest years are from the last three decades.

        <h2>Part 3.1 by Asger Andersen</h2>
        The data in our dataset is aggregrated by month. If we could get access to the daily temperature measurements, then we would be able to ask and visually explore new interesting questions, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>If we aggregate the temperature measurements by other methods than taking their mean, how does the evolvement of temperature then look as a function of time? For instance: How does a scatter plot of the mean of the 10 hottest days each year look?</li>
            <li>How does the variability of temperature within each year/season/month change as a function of time? For instance: How does a scatter plot of the each year's variance in the daily temperature during January look? What about the other months?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Part 3.3 by Christoffer Belhage</h2>
        The limit with regards to the size of the data-set depends on several factors:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How large a part must be in the user's RAM at any given time.<br>
                if the user has a sloppy computer with almost no available RAM, then a data-set of more than 100 MB could be too much.<br>
                Note that the size of our data-set was a mere 11.1KB.
            </li>
            <li>
                How many calculations are performed on the data.<br>
                If the computations performed are very intensive, then even a small data-set (Like ours) might be too much.<br>
                This factor is often open for optimization, through well written code.
            </li>
            <li>
                The visuals.<br>
                So this is really a subcategory of the previous bullet; With computationally heavy (Or just semi-heavy)
                visuals that scale with the size of the data-set (Maybe a 1:1 ratio of data-rows and HTML-elements?),
                the users CPU and RAM can quickly become overloaded.<br>
                Again, this should be flexible since there are few visuals that are simply <i>required</i> and can't be visualized differently.
            </li>
        </ul>

        So this means that the type of visualisations that are most likely to be too intense, are those that require dynamic modelling of very many HTML-elements.<br>
        Say for instance, that you somehow could model every person on the earth's current position;
        First of all, all the HTML elements required to display that would consume an immense amount of RAM.
        Secondly, if you were to continuously update all these elements, your processor would likely get some sort of cancer.<br>
        <br>
        The only way I could imagine dealing with this sort of visualisation, would be to only pick tiny bits at a time.
        And if an overview was required, then I would sub-sample the visuals; I.e. maybe one HTML-element for every million or ten million people.<br>
        <br>
        With regards to the data-set used in this assignment, we could have used only the yearly averages, but then one part of the visualisation would be gone.<br>
        We could also have sub-sampled the data-set, like pre-computing the averages of every five years.
        However, this would means that a lot of the variability would disappear.
