        We see at least one very attractive interactive feature that could be implemented;
        If the data-set was larger, i.e. containing information about the partners families,
        and also data about Donald Trump's ancestors, then being able to toggle parts of the tree would be great.
        This way the user could go exploring in the ancestry without having to see the entire data-set in one view,
        while not being constrained to only parts of the data.<br>
        We have seen examples of this kind of functionality, when looking for inspiration,
        but it seems that none of them allowed to completely "wander around" in the tree; It was sort of based in one node.
