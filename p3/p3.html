<h1>Assignment 3: Trees</h1>
<h2>The Trump Family</h2>
<div id="visualisation" class="section">
  <svg id = "trump_tree" width = "1600" height = "600">

    <h2>1)</h2>
    <div class="floaty text_box">
        The layout turned out as it did because we didn't have time to implement it as we would have liked to;
        Preferably, all partners would be horizontal and on same level as the Trump descendant,
        with bracket-style lines connecting them, and then a line coming down fra the bracket-line to the child/children.
        This would have been the typical style of a family tree, but we would probably have to implement most of it ourselves,
        without much help from the d3 tree library.<br>
        So, we have made some workarounds in order to illustrate which nodes are Trump-descendant, and which ones are married into the family.
        <br>
        First of all, the nodes without filling, are the married in husbands/wives (even if later divorced).
        Secondly, the lines connecting the Trump descendant with his/her partner(s) is a dashed line,
        in order to indicate a relationship that is not child / parent.<br>
        Conveniently, rows alternate between partners and children. Alternating colors could have been used
        to further illustrate the non-child relationships, but it would not add additional data, and might just end up confusing the viewer.
    </div>
    <h2>2)</h2>
    <div class="floaty text_box">
        We see at least one very attractive interactive feature that could be implemented;
        If the data-set was larger, i.e. containing information about the partners families,
        and also data about Donald Trump's ancestors, then being able to toggle parts of the tree would be great.
        This way the user could go exploring in the ancestry without having to see the entire data-set in one view,
        while not being constrained to only parts of the data.<br>
        We have seen examples of this kind of functionality, when looking for inspiration,
        but it seems that none of them allowed to completely "wander around" in the tree;
        Most were sort of based in one node, and then with toggleable branches.
